"""Add `lab_operations` — the durable work queue a lab worker will claim from.

Phase 1 of the lab-worker-ownership design (Knowledge slug
`academy-lab-worker-ownership-design-2026-09-18`): schema only. Nothing reads
or writes this table yet. `kind` and `state` are deliberately left without a
DB CHECK constraint — the enum of valid values is still settling and a later
migration will add the constraint once a worker actually exists to honor it.
`requested_by` is deliberately not a declared FK to `people` yet, for the same
reason.

The load-bearing invariant of this whole design lives in the grants, not the
columns, and it is narrower than "no UPDATE/DELETE": `app_user` gets
table-wide SELECT plus a *column-level* INSERT grant covering only
`id, tenant_id, instance_id, kind, requested_by` — the columns a request
actually needs to set. `state`, `attempts`, and every claim/settlement column
are left out of that grant entirely, so `app_user` cannot forge worker-owned
state (e.g. `state='claimed'`) at INSERT time either — denying UPDATE alone
would only stop changing an existing row, not establishing a false one at
creation. `platform_api` keeps table-wide SELECT only. `app_admin` is granted
full SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE explicitly: in production `app_admin` runs
the migration and is already the table owner, but CI runs migrations as the
`postgres` superuser (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), which owns the table
there instead — `GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO app_admin` in
`scripts/initdb-roles.sql` is schema-level (USAGE/CREATE) and does not cascade
into table ACLs, and `BYPASSRLS` bypasses row-visibility policies only, not
the base grant system. Without this explicit grant, Phase 2's worker
(claiming/settling as `app_admin`) would work in production but silently have
no privileges in CI.

Because `state`/`attempts` are excluded from `app_user`'s INSERT grant, the
ORM model must never carry a *client-side* default for them (see
`app/models/lab.py`): SQLAlchemy includes a column explicitly in the compiled
INSERT whenever it has a client-side default, even when the caller never set
it, which would hit the missing column privilege on every plain insert.
Relying on `server_default` only means the column is omitted from the INSERT
entirely when unset, and Postgres fills it in without needing INSERT
privilege on it.

The partial unique index `uq_lab_operations_open_per_instance` is the other
half: at most one `queued` or `claimed` operation may exist per instance at a
time, so a second deploy/destroy/check request for the same instance is
rejected at the database rather than racing an in-flight one.
