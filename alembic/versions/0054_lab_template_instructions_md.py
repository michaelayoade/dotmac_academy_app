"""Add `lab_templates.instructions_md` — the canonical Markdown source used to
render per-instance instructions (seed placeholders interpolated at request
time, not baked into stored HTML).

Rendered instructions must vary per learner (each `LabInstance.seed` differs),
so a single pre-rendered `instructions_html` per template can never carry that.
`instructions_md` is the stored canonical source projection the runtime
interpolates against; `instructions_html` is kept for backward compatibility
and as a fallback when a template predates this migration.

Backfilled from `instructions_html` on existing rows: it is valid Markdown
passthrough (a superset that markdown-in-markdown renders as literal text
around existing tags), and it preserves any literal `{{key}}` placeholders
that were already sitting unfilled in the stored HTML so they become
interpolatable immediately, without needing a re-import.

The column stays nullable — democode/demo template creation only supplies
`instructions_html`, and the read path already falls back to it when
`instructions_md IS NULL`.
