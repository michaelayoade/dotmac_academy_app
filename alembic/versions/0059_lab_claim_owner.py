"""Add `lab_operations.claimed_host`/`claimed_epoch` — structural claim
ownership for safe worker-restart reclaim.

`claimed_by` (migration 0055) already fences every heartbeat/settlement
comparison and stays the sole fencing value — this migration changes nothing
about that. Its composite string (`f"{hostname}:{pid}:{boot_token}"`,
`app.services.lab_operations.worker_identity()`) is, however, opaque to a
freshly-started worker process that wants to answer one narrow question
without parsing it: "did I myself already claim this exact row, in a
*previous* incarnation on *this* host, that never settled it?" That question
only matters at worker startup, before the ordinary polling loop begins.

`claimed_host` (the worker's hostname) and `claimed_epoch` (`f"{pid}:
{boot_token}"`) are a structural decomposition of the same identity, written
alongside `claimed_by` on every claim, purely so a startup reclaim scan
(`app.services.lab_operations.reclaim_previous_epoch`) can select
"`claimed_host` == my host AND `claimed_epoch` != my epoch" directly, instead
of string-parsing `claimed_by`. Neither column is ever compared in a fencing
predicate (`claim_next`/`heartbeat`/`_refresh_claim`/`_settle`/
`run_claimed`'s staleness checks) — only `claimed_by` is, unchanged.

No backfill, no data migration, no CHECK constraint, no new index: both
columns are nullable with no DDL default, and the existing
`ix_lab_operations_claim` (`state`, `not_before`, `requested_at`) index is
already sufficient for the ordinary claim-queue scan; the new startup reclaim
scan runs once per worker process lifetime, not per poll, so it does not need
its own index. `claimed_host`/`claimed_epoch` are excluded from `app_user`'s
column-scoped INSERT grant (migration 0055's five-column list is restated
here unchanged) for the same reason every other worker-owned column already
is: only `academy_lab_worker` may ever set structural claim ownership.

Grants: this migration re-issues `lab_operations`' full grant posture
explicitly (mirroring 0056/0058's restatement style for `lab_instances`)
rather than relying on the inherited, undocumented side effect of 0055's
table-level grants silently extending to these two new columns. `app_user`
gets table `SELECT` plus the same five-column INSERT grant 0055 established
(unchanged — `claimed_host`/`claimed_epoch` are deliberately NOT added to
it); `platform_api` keeps `SELECT`; `academy_lab_worker` keeps `SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE`; `app_admin`'s explicit migration/offline grant (established
by 0055 for CI parity with a superuser-owned table) is restated identically.

Rollout and rollback concerns: unlike 0058's `runtime_presence` (which
required a synchronized worker restart), this migration is NOT a hard
same-instant rollout requirement. An old (pre-0059) worker process running
against this new schema simply never sets `claimed_host`/`claimed_epoch` on
the claims it takes — those rows carry `NULL` structural ownership, so the
new startup reclaim scan (`claimed_host IS ...`, `claimed_epoch IS NOT NULL`)
never matches them and leaves them alone by construction. Such a claim falls
back to ordinary lease-expiry recovery (`reconcile_stuck`) exactly as it
would have before this migration existed — safe, just without restart-reclaim's
faster recovery for that one claim. A mixed old-worker/new-schema window is
therefore tolerable, not merely "safe if you're careful" — worth stating
explicitly since it is the exception rather than the rule among this table's
recent migrations.
