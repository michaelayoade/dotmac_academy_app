"""Add worker-owned `lab_operations.origin`/`runtime_precondition` — reconciler
conditional operations (item 4 of 4, restart-reclaim/capacity/reconciler
design).

This is the mechanism that closes the ordering bug an earlier, unauthorized
attempt at this slice got wrong: a "repair" operation the reconciler enqueues
(`db_only_repairs`/`missing_runtime` in `app/services/lab_jobs.py`) used to be
paired with the reconciler ITSELF immediately projecting the repaired
lifecycle state onto `LabInstance` (`status`/`error`/`runtime_presence`),
before the worker ever re-verified anything. If the runtime had already
changed again by the time the worker actually claimed and ran that operation,
the worker had no way to know its precondition no longer held — it would
either duplicate work harmlessly or, worse, tear down consoles / mutate the
runtime based on a stale assumption. `origin` and `runtime_precondition`
let the reconciler express its INTENT ("deploy this only if the runtime is
genuinely absent"; "destroy this only if the runtime is genuinely present")
without asserting the outcome — the worker (`app/services/lab_operations.py`,
`app/services/lab_lifecycle.py`) is the only party that ever observes the
runtime under the host lock and decides whether the precondition still holds,
and it does so BEFORE any console teardown or containerlab mutation, never
after.

`origin` is audit/provenance only — it identifies WHY a conditional operation
was created (`"runtime_repair"` for a conditional deploy, `"runtime_cleanup"`
for a conditional destroy). It never INDEPENDENTLY determines whether a
precondition holds — only `runtime_precondition` (`"absent"`/`"present"`)
does that. `origin` (together with `kind`) IS compared, but only to confirm
which of the two valid conditional shapes a row claims to be
(`app/services/lab_operations.py`'s `is_conditional_deploy`/
`is_conditional_destroy`); a malformed or mismatched shape (any tuple outside
the three this migration's CHECK constraint permits) is already rejected at
the database layer before this application code ever runs, so that
comparison can never itself misclassify an ordinary operation as
conditional or vice versa. Both columns are nullable and NULL for the
overwhelming majority of rows
(every ordinary, unconditional operation `request_idle_reaps`/
`reconcile_stuck`/`reclaim_previous_epoch` create) — this migration adds no
backfill, since every existing row already satisfies the "both NULL" CHECK
branch trivially.

The CHECK constraint (`ck_lab_operations_conditional_runtime`) permits exactly
three shapes: both NULL (ordinary), or one of the two valid
`(kind, origin, runtime_precondition)` triples described above. Explicit
`IS NOT NULL` guards are used on every branch (rather than relying on `IN`/
`=` alone) specifically so Postgres's three-valued CHECK logic cannot
silently accept a half-null combination — a CHECK constraint is satisfied
whenever it does not evaluate to FALSE, and an ordinary `=` comparison against
one NULL column evaluates to NULL (not FALSE), which would let a
half-populated row silently pass without an explicit `IS NOT NULL` on both
sides of every branch.

No NOT VALID/VALIDATE split (unlike 0058's `ck_lab_instances_runtime_presence`,
which needed one): that split exists specifically because 0058 added a NOT
NULL column with a backfill UPDATE touching every existing row, and
`VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` would otherwise share a lock-holding transaction with
that backfill scan. Neither new column here has a backfill: both start NULL
for every existing row (no `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT` at all),
which trivially satisfies the "both NULL" CHECK branch for every row that
already exists — there is no existing-row scan whose cost or lock duration
this migration needs to defer. A plain `ADD CONSTRAINT ... CHECK (...)` (no
`NOT VALID`) still validates only against the current (all-NULL-in-these-
columns) row set, which is cheap, so it is added directly.

Grants: mirrors 0055/0056/0058/0059's exact restatement style for
`lab_operations`. `app_user`'s column-scoped INSERT grant remains BYTE-
IDENTICAL to 0055's five-column list (`id, tenant_id, instance_id, kind,
requested_by`) — `origin`/`runtime_precondition` are deliberately NOT added
to it, since only the worker (via the reconciler's own `academy_lab_worker`-
authenticated session) may ever set them, exactly like every other worker-
owned column on this table. `platform_api` keeps `SELECT`; `academy_lab_worker`
keeps `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE`; `app_admin`'s explicit migration/offline grant
(established by 0055, restated by 0059) is restated identically here too.

Rollout and rollback concerns: forward rollout is a HARD synchronization
requirement, NOT a tolerable mixed-version window — the inverse of 0059's own
precedent for `claimed_host`/`claimed_epoch`, and more severe than 0058's.
An old (pre-0060) worker process has no concept of `origin`/
`runtime_precondition` at all: if a NEW (post-0060) reconciler enqueues a
conditional row while an old worker is still running, that old worker's
`run_claimed()` has no `is_conditional_deploy`/`is_conditional_destroy`
branch to take — it claims the row via its ordinary, UNCONDITIONAL deploy/
destroy code path instead, which can tear down or redeploy a runtime the
conditional operation's whole precondition-check design exists specifically
to protect. This is unlike 0059's `claimed_host`/`claimed_epoch` (an old
worker simply leaves two audit columns NULL and degrades gracefully to
lease-expiry recovery) and unlike 0058's `runtime_presence` (an old worker
under-counts capacity, a safety-preserving direction): here, an old worker
does not degrade gracefully or under-count — it takes an actively wrong,
potentially destructive action against a live runtime. Both the
`academy-labs` worker AND the `lab-reconcile` reconciler process MUST be
running post-0060 code before EITHER is allowed to enqueue or claim a row
against this schema; this is a mandatory input to the (separate,
not-yet-authorized) production rollout runbook, not something this migration
or any new application code can enforce or retrofit onto an
already-running old worker process by itself.

Downgrade must NEVER silently discard live conditional intent for an old
worker to misinterpret as unconditional: dropping `runtime_precondition` out
from under a still-`queued` or still-`claimed` conditional row would leave an
old (pre-0060) worker product a plain, unconditional deploy/destroy against
it — exactly the ordering bug this whole design exists to close, just moved
to the schema boundary instead of the code boundary. So `downgrade()` first
sets a bounded `lock_timeout` (so a concurrent, ordinary claim transaction
cannot hang this downgrade indefinitely), takes an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on
`lab_operations`, and explicitly checks for any row with
`state IN ('queued', 'claimed')` AND `runtime_precondition IS NOT NULL`. If
any such row exists, the downgrade raises and leaves the schema/constraint/
columns untouched — an operator must first let those rows settle (or fail
them out) before downgrading is safe. Only when none exist does the downgrade
proceed to drop the CHECK constraint and both columns, then restate the
grant posture.
