"""Academy-wide entrance-assessment defaults, keyed by tenant.

These two values used to be columns on `Tenant`. They are a product concern —
which question bank a new applicant sits, and for how long — and `Tenant` is a
platform model the kernel owns (`dotmac_kernel.models.Tenant`). Carrying them
there is what made this repo's tenancy model un-swappable: adopting the kernel's
`Tenant` would have dropped two columns that three call sites read.

So they live here instead, in a table this repo owns, keyed by `tenant_id`. The
rule generalises — a product concern that needs per-tenant configuration gets a
product-owned table, never an extra column on a platform table.

Not `tenant_id` on a shared "config" table either. A generic key/value bag is a
magnet: the next product concern lands in it, and two years later nothing owns
any row. One table per concern, owned by the service that resolves it —
`app.services.entrance_exam` is that service, and it is the only writer.

RLS-protected like every other tenant-keyed table here. `tenants` is exempt
because the resolver reads it before any context exists; this table has no such
reader — every caller runs inside a request, or under the BYPASSRLS admin role
the CLI setter uses.
