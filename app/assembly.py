"""The Academy product assembly (new Starter composition).

Mirrored from the legacy D8 assembly at genesis: same feature/owner
declarations, routers, web facet, roles and security policy. Deltas:
the Learning manifest is the released 0.1.0a6 module, migrations are
this repo's composed `alembic/versions` lineage, and product tables
are the a0001-a0006 genesis set.

Academy owns learning, admissions, lab, reporting, and product workflows. The
kernel owns application construction, tenancy startup, the generic security
middleware stack, liveness, static/template layering, and error translation.

Academy's retained product tables stay product-owned. The installed Learning
manifest owns its stateful namespace independently of Academy route visibility.
