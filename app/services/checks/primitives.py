"""Check primitives: command, probe, config_grep.

Each primitive takes ``(check, engine, handle, seed)`` and returns
``{"pass": bool, "actual": ..., "expected": ..., "detail": str}``.

``detail`` is the learner-facing sentence. A raw ``actual`` is often useless on
its own — a failed jsonpath read renders as "actual: None", which says nothing
about what went wrong — so every primitive explains what it observed in words.
Check authors add ``label`` and ``hint`` (see :mod:`app.services.checks.engine`)
for a human name and the corrective action.
