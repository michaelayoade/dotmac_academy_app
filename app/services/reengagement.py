"""Re-engagement of stranded learners — enrolled, but locked out of their own account.

A learner bulk-enrolled from an ERP roster has a Person row and a cohort seat
but never chose a password. To them the Academy is invisible: nudge emails point
at a login they cannot pass. Their *only* useful message is a fresh activation
link, so this module names that population and re-issues one.

Ownership: the stranded rule lives here; token minting follows the composed
stranded invitation policy (``invitation_issuance_policy(purpose="stranded")``)
and delivery stays with the outbox. This module decides *who*,
never *how* a token is made or a mail is sent. It is deliberately NOT an
at-risk detector — learners who can log in but don't are the Success Queue's,
and duplicating that rule here would create a second, drifting owner.
