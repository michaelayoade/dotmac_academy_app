"""Cross-tenant lab operation worker and enqueue-only idle reaper.

Unlike the per-request lifecycle helpers in :mod:`app.services.lab_lifecycle`
(which take ``db`` and only ``flush`` — the request handler owns the
transaction), these are background jobs that run across ALL tenants. They need
an offline/BYPASSRLS session that can see every tenant's rows and they OWN their
transaction boundary, so they ``commit``. Containerlab execution is narrower:
it requires the exact dedicated ``academy_lab_worker`` identity.

Use :func:`lab_worker_session` for containerlab worker/reconciler execution.
The pre-existing :func:`admin_session` remains the generic offline session used
by unrelated scheduled jobs and metrics; keeping the two credentials separate
prevents the web host from needing the lab worker DSN.

* :func:`drain_once` — claim and execute durable ``lab_operations`` rows.
* :func:`request_idle_reaps` — enqueue destroy intents without touching the
  engine (the web-host timer calls this).
* :func:`recover_missing_consoles` — repair worker-restart ttyd loss before
  draining more operations, without redeploying a live lab.

    Returns ``(queued_repairs, destroyed_rowless_orphans)``. Only Academy's
    ``dal-`` namespace is eligible for direct cleanup; unrelated containerlab
    runtimes on the same host are never touched.

    Structured in four phases so that host-lock contention (raised as
    :class:`~app.services.host_lock.HostLockUnavailable`, propagated to the
    caller) can never leave a half-applied repair plan behind:

    1. Locked inventory (``engine.inventory()`` — the lock is acquired and
       released inside the engine call itself).
    2. Database reads and repair-plan calculation. No row locks and no host
       lock are held here — this is pure computation over already-fetched
       data.
    3. Locked rowless-orphan destroys (``engine.destroy()`` per orphan, each
       independently acquiring/releasing the host lock). No database row is
       mutated in this phase, so if the host lock is contended partway
       through this loop, there is nothing to unwind.
    4. One more locked, fresh ``engine.inventory()`` call (replacing Phase
       1's snapshot for every decision below), followed by database
       projections/enqueues, only after every host operation this pass
       needed has already completed. Phase 3's destroys each carry their
       own multi-minute timeout, so real time passes between Phase 1/2's
       snapshots and Phase 4's mutations — long enough for an unrelated,
       concurrent operation (e.g. a user-initiated reset running via the
       normal worker path) to change an instance's true state, INCLUDING
       its actual runtime existence, in the meantime. Phase 4 therefore
       re-validates each candidate's CURRENT status, CURRENT open-operation
       membership, AND CURRENT runtime presence immediately before mutating
       it, rather than trusting either the Phase 1 or Phase 2 snapshot for
       anything beyond "this instance was structurally interesting enough
       to look at again" — otherwise a freshly-succeeded redeploy could be
       paved over with a needless destroy+redeploy cycle enqueued against
       stale data. (This function has now had four rounds of staleness
       hardening across its database and runtime state; a further
       staleness angle beyond this should be raised as a tracked decision
       rather than another silent patch here.)

    If either ``engine.inventory()`` call or an ``engine.destroy()`` call
    raises ``HostLockUnavailable``, this function does not catch it: it
    propagates to :func:`app.cli._lab_reconcile`, which rolls back this
    pass's (nonexistent, by construction — phases 1-3 make no database
    writes, and Phase 4's own re-inventory call happens before any of its
    mutations) and exits cleanly rather than raising, so the reconciler
    simply retries on its own 1-minute timer.
