"""Applicant-facing emails — acknowledgement and the entrance-exam invitation.

The exam link used to be rendered ONCE on the /apply response page. If the
candidate closed the tab, the token was gone forever and there was no way back
in — which is how 180 applicants produced zero sittings. The invitation email is
the durable copy of that link.

Sends are best-effort: ``send_email`` never raises and returns False when SMTP
is unconfigured, so a mail failure can never block an application.
