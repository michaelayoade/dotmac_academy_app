"""Who an enrolment is for — staff or external (ADR 0004).

The single writer of ``Enrollment.audience`` and ``Enrollment.employee_ref``.

This module **refuses to guess**. ERP owns employment, and identity between the
two systems is the employee reference, never a lowercased email match. The
Academy has no ERP read path today — the integration is an outbound webhook —
so classification is driven by an explicit roster supplied by ERP, and anything
not on that roster stays NULL rather than being defaulted to ``external``.

That is the point. 164 of 200 enrolments are staff and the only signal
currently available is whether the address ends ``@dotmac.ng``, which
misclassifies a staff member using a personal address and an external learner
issued a work one. An unclassified row is a question we have not answered; a
wrongly-defaulted row is a wrong answer that looks like a right one.
