"""At-risk / behind-pace detection + learner nudges.

Complements the agenda (which shows what's *upcoming*) by flagging what a
learner is *behind on*: a course whose offering window has closed without
completion (**overdue**), or where progress lags the elapsed window
(**behind**). Surfaced as in-app notifications via a daily sweep, mirroring
the email-digest job.

Signal uses only ``CourseCompletion.pct``/``status`` + the offering window, so
it needs no per-activity plumbing.
