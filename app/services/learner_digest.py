"""Weekly progress email for learners — what you did, where you are, what's next.

The Academy has never told a learner how they are doing. The existing weekly
digest (``cli.email-digest``) is a *cohort matrix for instructors*, and it has
never sent a single message: only four instructor enrolments exist against 202
students, and the setting gating it has been off since 2026-07-20. Learners had
to log in and look, which is precisely what a disengaged learner does not do.

This is a read-only projection. Course state comes from
``learner_dashboard.course_cards`` — the owner of that derivation — so the email
and the dashboard can never disagree about whether a course is in progress.
Delivery is the outbox's; this module only decides who gets what and when.
