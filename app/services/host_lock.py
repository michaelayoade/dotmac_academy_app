"""Host-level mutual exclusion for containerlab operations.

``containerlab`` mutates shared host state — the docker bridge, iptables/
nftables rules, ``/etc/hosts`` — that is not namespaced per lab. Two of these
run against the same lab host today with no serialisation between them:
``_lab_worker`` (a continuous 5s-poll loop draining durable operations) and
``_lab_reconcile`` (a 1-minute timer that inspects/repairs runtime drift).
Concurrent ``sudo containerlab`` invocations on different labs can therefore
race on that shared state. This module is the fix: a single host-wide,
non-blocking, crash-safe advisory lock both callers take before touching
containerlab.

Design notes (parallel to `dotmac_starter_mt`'s deployment lock, which is
inspiration only — this module has no dependency on that package):

- **Non-blocking.** ``fcntl.flock(..., LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)``. A worker or
  reconciler pass that BLOCKED waiting for the lock would stall its whole
  loop; refusing immediately and letting the caller retry on its own natural
  cadence (5s poll / 1min timer) is the safe answer.
- **The refusal names the holder.** The lock file records the holding PID and
  a caller-supplied label. Knowing the lock is held is useless without
  knowing which process holds it.
- **It survives a crash.** An advisory ``fcntl`` lock is released by the
  kernel the instant the holding process exits, however it exits — clean
  return, exception, SIGKILL. A lock implemented as "does this file exist"
  does not have this property, and requires an operator to notice and delete
  a stale lock file by hand.
- **The file is never deleted.** Unlinking it would open a window where one
  process has unlinked the path while another already opened the same inode,
  and both then believe they hold the lock — the classic lockfile race. An
  empty, never-truncated-away file costs nothing to keep around.
