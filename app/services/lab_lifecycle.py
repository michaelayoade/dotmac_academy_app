    whose runtime is observed present, UNCONDITIONALLY — never gated on
    whether ``consoles`` already looks populated.

    A conditional ("runtime_repair") deploy's own TARGET instance is, by
    construction, one ``reconcile_runtime``'s ``missing_runtime`` branch
    flagged specifically because its lifecycle ``status`` said active/
    provisioning/resetting while its RUNTIME WAS MISSING — such an instance
    routinely already has NON-EMPTY ``consoles`` on it, recorded from
    whenever it genuinely WAS running before the runtime disappeared. That
    recorded data is stale (referring to a now-dead deployment) BEFORE this
    conditional-deploy operation even begins, so "consoles already
    populated" can never be trusted as proof of a still-valid, live console
    session for a conditional deploy specifically — unlike an ordinary,
    unconditional deploy, there is no realistic concurrent-different-deploy
    case to protect here (the partial unique open-operation index already
    guarantees at most one open operation per instance, so an independent,
    genuinely concurrent redeploy of this SAME instance while this
    conditional op is claimed is not a real path).

    This also covers the narrower crash-then-retry gap: a worker crash
    between ``engine.deploy_if_absent()`` genuinely succeeding and this same
    attempt ever recording ``consoles``/``status`` leaves a real, running lab
    whose row shows a stale lifecycle status (and possibly stale, pre-repair
    consoles) once ``reclaim_previous_epoch`` requeues the interrupted
    operation (see ``app/services/lab_operations.py``'s conditional-deploy
    branch for the full sequence).

    A REAL, fresh, locked inspection (``engine.inspect_running`` — never a
    redeploy) runs FIRST, BEFORE any console is touched. ``stop_consoles``
    only runs once that call has already returned successfully WITH A REAL
    HANDLE — never before it, never if it raises, and never on a clean
    ``None`` either (see the later paragraph below: a clean ``None`` leaves
    ``consoles``/``status``/``error`` completely untouched instead).

    This ordering is load-bearing, not cosmetic: ``inspect_running`` ->
    ``ContainerlabEngine._inspect_running_handle_unlocked`` -> its own
    ``_inspect_all()`` is fallible for real, ordinary reasons — a non-zero
    ``containerlab inspect`` return code (subprocess failure, host
    contention, timeout) or invalid JSON output both raise ``RuntimeError``
    (see ``_inspect_all``'s own deliberate error handling). An earlier
    version of this function called ``stop_consoles`` unconditionally
    FIRST, reasoning that it was "safe and correct even if what is recorded
    is already stale/dead" — but that reasoning only accounted for
    ``inspect_running`` returning cleanly (a handle or ``None``), never for
    it raising. If it raised AFTER ``stop_consoles`` had already killed the
    real local ttyd console process(es) for this instance, that teardown
    could not be undone by any DB rollback: the operation would error out
    with consoles already destroyed and no way to rebuild them, and — since
    the runtime is genuinely PRESENT in this exact code path (that is why a
    resync was attempted rather than a deploy) — the instance would not be
    "missing_runtime" either, so neither reconciler repair branch
    (``db_only_repairs``/``missing_runtime`` in ``lab_jobs.py``) would ever
    pick it back up automatically. There was no self-healing path back to
    working consoles.

    Reordering so ``inspect_running`` runs first closes that gap while
    preserving every existing invariant this function relies on: teardown
    still happens before any rebuild, and only once a fresh handle is
    actually in hand. The only change is that a RAISE from the inspection
    itself now propagates before any console is touched, so nothing
    destructive happens and the existing operation-level error handling
    (retry/ceiling machinery in ``lab_operations.py``, unchanged by this
    fix) can safely retry later with consoles still intact.

    Then converges to exactly the same end state a normal successful
    deploy would reach — for every case: stale-non-empty, empty, and the
    rare already-fully-correct case, which is just harmlessly reconfirmed
    (at the minor cost of a brief console restart). If the fresh inspection
    unexpectedly disagrees (does not find the instance running after all —
    e.g. a genuine, separate destroy raced in in the meantime, or
    ``ContainerlabEngine.inspect_running``'s own topology-path ownership
    check refused an untrusted same-name match), presence is conservatively
    set to "unknown" rather than asserting a lifecycle state with no real
    console data behind it. On this ``handle is None`` outcome,
    ``consoles``/``status``/``error`` are now left COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED —
    not torn down — because the runtime is genuinely present on this code
    path (that is why a resync was attempted in the first place): if
    ``inspect_running`` cannot confirm a handle (a genuine race where the
    lab was destroyed in between; the engine's own topology-path ownership
    check legitimately refusing an unverifiable match; or the fresh
    inspection's own parser failing to reconstruct a handle for some other
    reason), we have no positive proof either way, so we must not destroy
    the one thing — an existing live console — that might still be
    correctly serving the instance, especially since no reconciler branch
    self-heals a ``runtime_presence="unknown"`` instance whose ``status``
    still looks active. ``stop_consoles`` therefore only runs once a fresh
    handle IS obtained, exactly mirroring ``provision_if_absent``'s own
    "teardown only after mutation/observation proven" principle — extended
    here to mean "only after a POSITIVE observation," not any observation.

    claim" pattern does — deliberately, not by oversight. That pattern
    exists to protect a genuinely non-idempotent, non-safely-retriable
    action: an actual ``containerlab deploy`` cannot simply be re-run if the
    claim is lost mid-flight, which is exactly why ``deploy_if_absent``'s own
    precondition check exists. ``stop_consoles``/``start_console`` are not
    that: ``stop_consoles`` matches live processes by ``instance.id`` alone
    (``console_pids``), not by a specific PID/port, so a subsequent retry of
    this same reclaimed operation harmlessly cleans up and rebuilds
    regardless of what a prior, abandoned attempt left running. No capacity
    reservation is being made on this path either — the runtime was already
    observed present, so there is no admission decision to protect. If the
    claim were lost mid-flight (a narrow window bounded by ``_refresh_
    claim``'s own heartbeat reset plus at most two ~60s-timeout inspect
    calls), the final settlement's fencing check would roll back the
    in-memory DB projection while these external actions had already
    happened for real — an accepted residual property of this branch, not a
    defect, precisely because those actions are idempotent/self-healing by
    construction.

    LOAD-BEARING ORDERING (see migration ``0060_lab_conditional_ops.py``'s
    module docstring for the full design rationale — an earlier, unauthorized
    attempt at this exact slice got this ordering wrong) FOR THE PRECONDITION-
    HOLDS (genuinely absent) PATH — the actual mutation this operation may
    perform:

        locked precondition check
        -> conditional containerlab mutation, IF the precondition allows it
        -> console teardown, ONLY IF a mutation actually occurred
        -> console recreation / final state projection

    ``engine.deploy_if_absent()`` performs the precondition check AND the
    mutation atomically inside one host-lock acquisition (see
    ``ContainerlabEngine.deploy_if_absent``) — this function never calls
    ``stop_consoles``/``start_console``/any topology mutation before that
    call has already returned a real handle proving the mutation occurred.

    The PRECONDITION-MISMATCH (runtime observed present) path is different
    and does NOT follow "teardown only if a mutation occurred": see below —
    it always tears down and resyncs, because the observation itself (not a
    mutation this operation performed) is what authoritatively confirms the
    runtime's current state, and any previously-recorded consoles on this
    specific operation kind's target instance are untrustworthy regardless.

    A precondition MISMATCH (``deploy_if_absent`` returns ``None`` — the
    runtime was found genuinely present, whether by this call's own
    authoritative check or a caller's own earlier preliminary check racing
    against it) settles unconditionally through
    :func:`_rebuild_consoles_from_live_inspection` — see its own docstring
    for why any pre-existing ``consoles`` on THIS conditional deploy's own
    target instance are untrustworthy by construction (routinely stale data
    from before the runtime this operation is repairing ever disappeared),
    so there is no "preserve as-is" branch here: a fresh, authoritative
    inspection runs first, and only once it confirms a live handle is
    whatever is currently recorded stopped and the row rebuilt from that
    live truth.

    ``preserved_status``/``preserved_error`` ARE read on this path — this
    corrects an earlier version of this docstring which claimed they were
    "therefore no longer read on this path". They are read specifically to
    restore the row when that follow-up inspection ALSO cannot confirm
    presence (``runtime_presence`` still ``"unknown"`` afterward): the
    caller's earlier, already-committed capacity-admission transaction left
    ``instance.status`` at a transient reservation placeholder
    (``"resetting"``/``"provisioning"``) that no ordinary settle path ever
    produces on its own, and leaving it there would let
    ``reconcile_stuck``'s stuck-row sweep later force it through an
    unconditional, potentially destructive destroy+redeploy cycle against a
    runtime this conditional operation had correctly declined to touch. So
    the row is restored to its true pre-admission ``status``/``error``
    instead — UNLESS that true pre-admission ``status`` was itself already
    one of the transient-looking values (``"queued"``/``"provisioning"``/
    ``"resetting"`` — a legitimate starting point for a ``missing_runtime``
    repair target), in which case restoring it verbatim would return the
    row to exactly the same stuck-row sweep trigger shape, so it is
    escalated to ``"error"`` instead. They remain unused only on the
    confirmed-present sub-case, where
    :func:`_rebuild_consoles_from_live_inspection` itself already sets
    ``status="active"``/``error=None`` authoritatively.

    """Legacy direct reset helper retained until the separately gated removal phase.

    Web routes never call this helper: they enqueue a durable deploy operation,
    and the lab worker owns destroy-then-deploy, capacity admission, leases,
    and settlement. This guard still keeps any direct service caller from
    bypassing those boundaries while the compatibility helper remains.

    Only ``active`` or ``error`` (a previously-failed deploy, retryable) may
    be reset; every other status is refused up front, before any engine
    interaction. This is an allow-list, not just a reaped exclusion:
    ``queued``/``provisioning`` are the capacity-controlled deployment path
    owned by ``lab_operations.run_claimed()`` (which enforces the effective
    capacity limit before calling ``provision()``) — resetting a ``queued`` instance would
    deploy it immediately and bypass that cap entirely, and resetting a
    ``provisioning`` one would race the worker's own ``provision()`` call on
    the same row/work directory. ``reaped`` (already-destroyed) is refused
    because a successful reset unconditionally sets ``status="active"``,
    which would resurrect it. This guard lives here — not in the web route —
    so it applies to every current and future caller of ``reset()``, not just
    the one route that exists today.

    Mirrors ``provision``'s guarded-deploy shape and its topology preparation:
    ``_set_topology_name()`` is applied the same way so the redeployed
    container names still follow the ``clab-<instance>-<node>`` convention
    ``handle_for`` expects — a reset that skipped this could deploy under the
    wrong name and silently desync from every other reader of ``consoles``.
    An engine/interpolation failure is recorded onto the row
    (``status="error"``) rather than propagating out as an unhandled
    exception — a legacy direct caller gets a normal return in either outcome.
    Only the ``db.flush()`` itself is left
    unguarded, since a database/transaction failure is not something this
    function can meaningfully paper over.

    Old ttyd consoles are stopped BEFORE the fresh ones are started —
    mirroring ``destroy()``'s ordering — because ``stop_consoles()`` matches
    processes by ``instance.id`` alone (see ``console_pids()``), not by the
    specific port each one was launched on. Calling it after starting the new
    consoles would kill the ones just spawned for the same instance, since
    they're indistinguishable from the old ones by that pattern.

    On success, ``instance.consoles`` is rebuilt from the fresh
    :class:`LabHandle` ``engine.reset()`` returns (mgmt IPs and console ports
    can change on redeploy) — the same node/console-spawn loop ``provision``
    uses, so a "successful" reset never leaves stale console/mgmt data on the
