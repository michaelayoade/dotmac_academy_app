# Reading Dashboards & Reports

Collecting good numbers is half the discipline; reading them without
fooling yourself is the other half. The same dashboard supports opposite
conclusions in careless hands — panic over a normal wobble, calm over a
real decline, credit for a rebound that was coming anyway. This chapter
is the manager's reading skill: trends over snapshots, noise versus
signal, seasonality, outliers, and the standing question every number
deserves: *could this be lying to me?*

**By the end of this chapter you can:**

- Refuse a snapshot and ask for the line, with a window you did not choose
  to flatter.
- Check the denominator and the mix before believing any movement.
- Separate a normal wobble from a pattern worth acting on.
- Recognise a seasonal shape and stop it being reported as performance.
- Investigate an outlier before it rewrites the story, and name the ways a
  number can be lying to you.

## Trends beat snapshots

A single number — "87% on-time this week" — is almost uninterpretable
alone. Is that good? Improving? Collapsing? The information lives in
**comparison**: against the baseline (Chapter 3), against the same period
last year, against the path to target, and above all against the metric's
own recent history. The first habit of numerate management is refusing
the snapshot: every KPI displayed as a line over time, not a lone figure
in a box. The line answers in one glance what the box cannot — direction,
pace, and whether this week is remarkable at all.

Three refinements make lines trustworthy:

- **Windows matter.** A week of data shows weather; a year shows climate.
  Judge tactical moves on short windows, the team's health on long ones —
  and be suspicious of any presentation that chooses its window to
  flatter (the rally since March looks less heroic on the two-year line
  that shows March as the bottom of a slide).
- **Rates, denominators, and mix.** A rising complaint count under
  doubling customers is *improvement*; a "record month" of output during
  a mix-shift to easy jobs is not. Before believing any move, ask what
  the denominator did — and whether the mix of work changed under the
  number.
- **Averages hide; distributions tell.** The average resolution time can
  hold steady while a tail of ancient cases grows (the Finance course
  made the same point about revenue per customer). Watch a spread
  measure — median plus the worst tenth, or the oldest open item —
  wherever the tail is where the damage lives.

## Worked example: the same five months, two opposite conclusions

A service business reviews complaints over five months.

| Month | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Complaints received | 20 | 24 | 28 | 33 | 38 |
| Customers served | 400 | 500 | 620 | 780 | 950 |
| **Complaints per 100 customers** | **5.0** | **4.8** | **4.5** | **4.2** | **4.0** |

Read the first row alone and complaints are up **90%** — a crisis, and the
kind of chart that gets a service manager summoned. Read the third row and
the complaint rate has fallen by a fifth, while the business grew 138%.
Service is not deteriorating. It is improving, during rapid growth, which is
the hard case.

Both rows are true and drawn from the same data. Only one answers the
question anyone actually cares about.

This is the single most common way a dashboard misleads, and it does not
require anyone to be dishonest — it only requires the denominator to go
unmentioned. The habit that defends against it is mechanical: **before
believing any movement, ask what the denominator did.**

Note also what the rate row does *not* excuse. Thirty-eight complaining
customers are still thirty-eight people with a problem, and the absolute
number is what the complaints team must staff for. The rate tells you
whether the process is getting better; the count tells you how much work is
arriving. A dashboard that shows only one of them is half a picture, which
is why the table above shows all three rows rather than the "right" one.

## Noise, signal, and the wobble

Every metric bounces. Staffing, luck, weather, which day the month ended
on — all of it shakes the line without meaning anything. The baseline
work of Chapter 3 told you each metric's **normal range**; reading is
applying it: a point inside the usual wobble is *weather*, and reacting
to it — the Friday interrogation over a two-point dip that reverses
itself Monday — is worse than doing nothing. It burns the team's trust
in the numbers, generates explanations for randomness (which then get
believed), and trains everyone to manage the wobble instead of the work.

What deserves attention is **pattern**: a run of periods on one side of
the baseline, a step-change that persists, a slow consistent drift, or a
point far outside the normal range. The eye is bad at this distinction
and worse under pressure — which is why the range belongs *drawn on the
chart* (even informally: "we normally land between 71 and 79"), so that
"is this real?" is answered by looking, not arguing.

## Seasonality and the calendar

Many businesses breathe with the calendar — paydays, seasons, holidays,
school terms. A metric with rhythm must be read against it: compare to
the *same period last cycle*, not the period before. The December dip
that recurs every December is not this quarter's crisis, and the manager
who "fixes" it every year is taking credit for January. Know your
rhythms, mark them on the chart, and reserve alarm for departures *from
the pattern* — the December dip that came deeper, or didn't recover.

## Outliers: circle them, then decide

One wild point — a catastrophic day, a huge one-off order — can drag an
average and repaint a whole month. When an outlier appears: **first
verify it** (a decent share of outliers are data errors — a mistyped
figure, a double-count, a broken feed); **then understand it** (one-off
event, or first sign of something structural?); **then report honestly
both with and without it** ("the month was fine except the flood week;
here's both views"). What you may not do is silently delete it — or
silently keep it and let one strange day masquerade as a trend. Outliers
are where Chapter 1's promise that numbers end arguments gets tested;
handle them in daylight or the arguments return, now about the data.

## When the number is lying

The standing question. Numbers lie in recognisable ways, and the reading
manager runs the checklist whenever a story seems too tidy:

- **Definition drift** — the metric improved because what counts changed
  (Chapter 2's undefined edges, resolved in the flattering direction).
- **Collection gaps** — the complaints fell because the recording did;
  silence in the data is not peace (the Customer Experience course's
  gaming section is this same alarm, rung for service metrics).
- **Survivorship** — averages computed only over what remained: the
  satisfaction of customers who stayed, the cycle time of jobs that
  finished. The departed and the stuck are the story, and they're not in
  the sample.
- **Correlation dressed as cause** — two lines moving together prove
  little; the confident narrative connecting them is a theory to test
  (Decision Making's evidence discipline), not a conclusion to act on.
- **The dashboard that's always green** — the deepest tell. Real
  operations wobble and sometimes fail; a wall of steady green means
  thresholds set too loose, metrics chosen too safe, or truth filtered
  on the way up. Trust dashboards that sometimes bring bad news; audit
  the ones that never do.

Reading well is ultimately a temperament: curious before the anomaly,
calm before the wobble, suspicious of the flattering, and always willing
to walk from the chart to the floor and check the number against the
thing itself.

## Do this at work

1. **Convert one count to a rate.** Take a number your area reports as a
   total and divide it by whatever grew underneath it. If the two rows
   point different ways, you have found a conclusion that needs correcting
   before someone acts on it.
2. **Redraw one chart on a longer window.** Take a recent success story and
   plot it over two years instead of six months. Does the rally still look
   like a rally, or like a recovery from a dip nobody mentioned?
3. **Mark the normal range.** On your most-watched chart, draw the band the
   metric usually sits in. Then count how many past "interventions"
   responded to points inside it.
4. **Check a mix shift.** Find a period your team's output rose and ask
   whether the *kind* of work changed. Easy-job months look like good
   months from a distance.
5. **Look at your tail, not your average.** For one metric with a duration
   — resolution time, age of open items — find the worst tenth. That
   number is usually the one customers talk about.
6. **Audit an always-green dashboard.** Find a report in your organisation
   that has not shown bad news in a year. Either the thresholds are loose,
   the metrics are safe, or the truth is being filtered before it arrives.
   All three are worth knowing.

## Summary

- Never read snapshots: every KPI as a line against baseline, target
  path, and last cycle — with windows chosen for truth, not flattery.
- Check denominators, mix, and distributions before believing any move;
  averages hide the tail where damage lives. Complaints rising 90% while
  the complaint *rate* falls a fifth is the same data telling opposite
  stories — and needs nobody to be dishonest, only the denominator to go
  unmentioned.
- Know each metric's normal wobble and react only to pattern — runs,
  steps, drifts, and far-outside points. Reacting to noise is worse than
  nothing.
- Read seasonal metrics against the same period last cycle; alarm at
  departures from rhythm, not the rhythm.
- Verify outliers, understand them, report with-and-without — never
  silently drop or keep them.
- Run the lying-number checklist: definition drift, collection gaps,
  survivorship, correlation-as-cause — and distrust the dashboard that
  is always green.
