"""Real ``academy_lab_worker`` privilege matrix and worker-consequence integration test.

Skips cleanly when ``TEST_LAB_WORKER_DATABASE_URL`` is unset (see the
``lab_worker_session`` fixture in ``tests/conftest.py``) — this is the one test
in the suite that requires a real, live-verified ``academy_lab_worker`` role rather than
the migration/superuser connection ``admin_session`` provides, because its
whole point is to catch an incomplete or overbroad grant that a superuser
connection would never surface.

Uses a stub (``MagicMock``) containerlab engine only — never a real one.
