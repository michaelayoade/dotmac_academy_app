"""`propose_balance` must only ever suggest editing a distractor.

The whole approach rests on one property: a distractor is already the wrong
answer, so appending a hedge that asserts no new fact cannot make it more or
less wrong. The same hedge on a *correct* answer would be a content change, and
on an explanation it would be a factual claim. If a future edit let this touch
anything but a distractor, the safety argument would silently stop holding —
these tests are what keeps that from happening quietly.
