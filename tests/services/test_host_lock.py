"""Host-wide containerlab lock: contention, holder naming, and crash-release.

No live database is needed anywhere in this file — the lock is pure
filesystem/fcntl behavior, and the one ``reconcile_runtime``/``_lab_reconcile``
test doubles the database session entirely because both functions are proven
here to make no database call before a host-lock contention can be raised.

Worker-side deferral/refund behavior on ``HostLockUnavailable`` (Stream A's
``run_claimed`` contract) belongs in that stream's own test file and is
deliberately not duplicated here.
