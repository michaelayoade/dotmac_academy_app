"""Pin the exam behaviour that exists today, before it moves into the engine.

The entrance exam is live and ranking real candidates, so the refactor has to
prove it changed nothing. These tests capture the *current* selection and option
order for fixed inputs; they are written against the public functions so they
keep passing after those functions delegate to the engine.

If one of these fails during the refactor, a candidate's paper changed.
