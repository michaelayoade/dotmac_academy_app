"""Role admission over the real web path: a signed-in account with no standard role is refused.

The Academy web facet admits only student/instructor/admin (permission academy.web.access).
This is the behavioural proof: real login form, the kernel's double-submit CSRF and the kernel
admission path, with nothing patched. The same account then receives the student role and is
admitted. (tests/architecture/test_academy_web_facet.py proves the declaration; this proves the
behaviour. See also the warning in tests.conftest.grant_role.)
