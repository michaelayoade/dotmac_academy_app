"""Cross-tenant isolation canaries.

These tests are the load-bearing invariant for the whole architecture. If they fail,
something is wrong at the routing, application, or RLS layer — and the failure mode
is "data leak between customers", which is unacceptable.

Every new tenant-scoped table MUST add a parallel test in this file (or sibling).

The tests run against a real Postgres because RLS doesn't exist in SQLite. Set
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a disposable Postgres before running.
